# Austin Weather
My first WordPress plugin, coded in 2014.

The **Austin Weather** plugin is designed to display current weather conditions for Austin, Texas, sourced from the National Weather Service's XML feed for Camp Mabry (KATT).

Upon activation, the plugin creates a shortcode `[weather_conditions]` which can be embedded into any post or page within a WordPress website. When the shortcode is used, the plugin retrieves the latest weather data from the specified XML feed, parses it, and then displays relevant weather information such as the current weather condition, temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and observation time.

Additionally, the plugin enqueues a CSS stylesheet to style the weather conditions display, providing a visually appealing presentation of the weather information.
